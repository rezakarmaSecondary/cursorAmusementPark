This directory contains the database migration scripts for the Amusement Park People Counting System.

The migrations are managed using Alembic, a database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.

To create a new migration:
1. Make changes to your models in app/models.py
2. Run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"`
3. Review the generated migration file
4. Apply the migration: `alembic upgrade head`

To rollback a migration:
- Run: `alembic downgrade -1` (rolls back one migration)
- Or: `alembic downgrade <revision>` (rolls back to specific revision)
